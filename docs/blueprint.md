## Core Features:

- User Onboarding: Collect user's health details (age, weight, height, activity level, goals) to personalize the diet plans using a clear, step-by-step form.
- AI Diet Plan Generation: Generate a daily diet plan based on the user's onboarding details and preferences. The AI tool considers caloric needs, macronutrient ratios, and dietary restrictions.
- Homepage Dashboard: Display daily calorie goals, macronutrient targets, and suggested foods based on the generated diet plan.
- Food Recognition: Allow users to upload food photos and detect the food items using AI. This uses the 'Clarifai' Food Model for accurate estimation of calorie and macro content.
